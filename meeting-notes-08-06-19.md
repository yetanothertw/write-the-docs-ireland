# [Write the Docs Ireland](https://www.meetup.com/Write-The-Docs-Ireland/)
### Social Meetup Notes and Agenda

#### June 8th, 2019


**Attendees:** Vlada, Stephen, Ania, Richard


**Agenda:** The goal is to meet fellow documentarians over coffee, make introductions and have fun discussing docs.


**Meeting Minutes:**

The following are some of the topics we briefly discussed and want to learn more about:
* Remote work possibilities in Ireland
* Desire to reach beyond simple documentation responsibilities (sometimes are grounded by corporate view constraints)
* Looking for ways to bring attention to the merit of documentation
* Providing training to engineering teams on docs practices
* Other Docs Conferences (SOAP)
* Knowledge sharing
* A comprehensive approach to technical documentation (content strategy, information architecture, content developers, technical writers , “the big picture”)
* Interviewing tactics
* Gathering statistics (reader behaviour, patterns)
* Static site generators
* Breeding documentation culture in your company
* Alarming trends: decreased interest in reading and subsequently writing
* Theory of learning
* How to convince your manager of the benefits of open source contributions?
* Open Source collaboration guide for docs contributions.
* How to convince your (non-docs) manager of importance of quality docs?
* Decisions, arguments, pros and cons relating to the documentation presentation layer. How is such a decision reached, what influences it and how is this measured?
* There is a strong need for a community of like-minded folks!
* this is a test message

**Actions:**
* Edit the WTD meetup page (currently out of date info, for example location)
* Schedule the next meetup (same social round-table discussion format) in 3 weeks, preferably during the work week (Wednesday or Thursday afternoon)
* Establish a rotation for discussion moderators for every meetup (Ania, thank you for volunteering)
* Set an agenda for the next meetup
* Make the notes available to the group
